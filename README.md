# DEPLOYMENT TO APP SERVICE

The repo contains deployment script workflow of github actions.   I don't know what I was following when I creaated that.  It uses Managed Identity to deploy, instead of the standard Publish Profiles downloADed form the App Svc.   The Managed Identities are assiogn `Web Contributor` role on the App Svcs.
